This mysterious pilot turns out to be the older version of himself from the future, where time travel is in its infancy. He has risked everything to come back in time on a secret mission. Together they must embark on an adventure into the past to find their father, set things right, and save the world. The three working together, both young and grown Adam come to terms with the loss of their father and have a chance to heal the wounds that have shaped them. Adding to the challenge of the mission, the two Adams discover they really don’t like each other very much, and if they’re going to save the world, they’re first going to have to figure out how to get along.</p>\n",

This mysterious pilot turns out to be the older version of himself from the future, where time travel is in its infancy. He has risked everything to come back in time on a secret mission. Together they must embark on an adventure into the past to find their father, set things right, and save the world. The three working together, both young and grown Adam come to terms with the loss of their father and have a chance to heal the wounds that have shaped them. Adding to the challenge of the mission, the two Adams discover they really don’t like each other very much, and if they’re going to save the world, they’re first going to have to figure out how to get along.\n",

This mysterious pilot turns out to be the older version of himself from the future, where time travel is in its infancy. He has risked everything to come back in time on a secret mission. Together they must embark on an adventure into the past to find their father, set things right, and save the world. The three working together, both young and grown Adam come to terms with the loss of their father and have a chance to heal the wounds that have shaped them. Adding to the challenge of the mission, the two Adams discover they really don’t like each other very much, and if they’re going to save the world, they’re first going to have to figure out how to get along.\\n\\n* * *\\n[“Gimme Some Lovin'” by The Spencer Davis Group]\\n♪ Hey ♪\\n♪ Well, my temperature’s risin’ And my feet on the floor ♪\\n♪ Crazy people knockin’ ‘Cause they’re wantin’ some more ♪\\n♪ Let me in, baby I don’t know what you got ♪\\n♪ But you better take it easy ♪\\n♪ This place is hot… ♪\\n[man 1] That’s not good.\\n♪ And I’m so glad we made it ♪\\n♪ So glad we made it ♪\\n♪ You gotta gimme some lovin’… ♪\\n[gasps]\\n♪ Gimme, gimme some lovin’… ♪\\n[bleeping]\\n[grunts]\\n[woman on comms] What are you doing, Captain?\\nI think it’s pretty obvious.

I don’t wanna be here any more than you want me here.\\nI just gotta stop bleeding long enough.\\nGotta dress the wound, prevent a nasty infection,\\nand I will be on my merry way.\\nDon’t touch that.\\nI was just looking.\\nDon’t touch my stuff.\\nIs this a lightsaber?\\nNo, it’s not.\\nOkay.\\nNo. Enough with the bat!\\n[clattering]\\nIf I wanted to hurt you, I would have.\\nIf I’m being honest with myself, you have a very punchable face.\\nOh my…\\nGod! That…\\nGah! That bullet went straight through. Good.\\nCool.\\nWait, wait, wait. Bullet? You were shot?\\nYeah… No, actually, no.\\nNo, I was stabbed with a bullet. What do you think, you moron?\\nI’m a moron? You’re the one who was shot.\\nAll right, okay, that’s it. [coughs]\\n[farting sound]\\nThat… Wow… That, uh…\\nThat’s weird. It farts when I cough.\\n[coughs]\\n[farting sound]\\nGross.\\nSuper gross.\\nI’m gonna go upstairs, grab some stuff. Stay cool. You can trust me.\\nEasy for you to say. I’m the one who ends up in a therapist’s office,\\ntelling them about where the bad man touched me.\\nOh God! That’s where you go? Immediately? You are dark, man.\\n[young Adam] Who even are you?\\nThat is classified.\\nWhy are you here?\\nAlso classi… classified.\\nAre you in the air force?\\nWhen I say “classified,” what does your brain hear? Chocolate?\\nWhat’s with the lightsaber?\\nIt’s not a lightsaber.\\nJesus Christ, Adam.\\nI need you to play it cool.\\nWait.\\nI know playing it cool isn’t your thing.\\nWait.\\nIt never has been…\\nWait, wait! How do you know my name?\\nYou’re Adam Reed. Born February 10th, 2010.\\nYour parents are Ellie and Louis Reed. Louis would’ve died about a year ago.\\nYou don’t play any sports because of acute asthma.\\nPlus you’re freakishly small for 12.\\n[frantic barking]\\nYou go to Franklin Middle School,\\nwhere you’ve been suspended two, three times for fighting,\\nwhich is ironic because you can’t fight to save your life.\\n[in unison] Hawking! Zip it!\\n[whines]\\nHow do you know my dog’s name?\\nBecause I named him.\\nWhere are you goin’?\\n[gasps]\\n[wheezing]\\nOh God.\\n[shakes inhaler] All right.\\nHere, ready? Deep breath.\\nHold it.\\nThree, two, one.\\n[exhales]\\nEverybody gets a trophy.\\n[grunts]\\nWhen I was seven,\\nI ran into a table on the patio.\\nI got 12 stitches.\\n[in unison] Right here.\\nYou knew how to get into my dad’s garage.\\nYou knew how to close the fridge.\\nYou knew how to time my breathing.\\nWe have the same scar.\\nAnd you’re wearing my dad’s watch.\\nThis watch.\\nThis watch.\\nYou’re me.\\nHoly shi…\\nThat’s classified. But yes…\\nI once was.\\n[coughs]\\n[wound farts]\\nI can’t believe you’re future me.\\nOkay, you came to terms with that pretty quickly.\\nIt’s a little disturbing, actually.\\nSo why are you here?\\nRescue mission.\\nI wasn’t supposed to land here. I was aiming for 2018.\\nI need to get there as soon as possible.\\nWho were you trying to save in 2018?\\nReally?\\nFine. Can you at least tell me how you got here?\\nI’ll show ya.\\n[whooshing]\\n[power crackles and fades]\\nWhat was that?\\nCrap.\\nWhat?\\nUh, we’re gonna switch to plan A, which is where you come in.\\nYou see, time jets, like all tech in the future,\\nis coded to its user’s DNA.\\nBecause I’m injured… aah, the jet won’t even clear me to fly,\\nwhich means I can’t get in there to fix her.\\nBut guess who can?\\n[whirring]\\n[power building]\\n[engine humming]\\nThere she is.\\n[dramatic music playing]\\n[Adam] Away we go.\\nOkay. Sit down.\\nOh my God.\\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Sit down.\\nLet’s see what we’re dealing with here. All right, some minor shield damage.\\nCoolant leaks.\\n[beeping]\\nI don’t know what that is, but when is a flashing red light ever good?\\nAh-da-da-da-da-da.\\nI know you wanna touch all the pretty buttons\\nwith your sticky little child fingers, but the reactor has a quantum signature.\\nYou fire it up, they can find us.\\nIf they’re here.\\nWho are “they”?\\nI’m glad that you didn’t ask me that because “they” are classified.\\nI already know you’re from the future.\\nBelieve me, I regret that.\\nI had no intention of coming back to revisit… this.\\nJesus. Okay.\\n[chiming]\\nOkay, I’ve isolated the damaged relays,\\nso the ship should be able to start repairing itself.\\nHow long will that take?\\nAh, it’s at 50% capacity,\\nso hopefully less time than it takes me to heal.\\n[young Adam] Wait.\\nDo you remember this?\\nRemember what?\\nThis. Right here, right now.\\nYou being here in 2022?\\nKnow where you’re going with this.\\nIf this is happening to me…\\nYou’re wasting your time.\\nThat means it already happened to you.\\nUnless it works like a multiverse,\\nwhere each ripple creates an alternate timeline…\\nIt’s not a multiverse!\\nMy God, we watched too many movies.\\nI just wanna know.\\n[sighs]\\nOkay.\\nOkay, the prevailing wisdom is that when I go back to my fixed time,\\nmy memory… our memories, they reform, they reconcile.\\nBut not while I’m here.\\nFixed time? What’s that?\\nThere’s only one place in time where you belong on a quantum level,\\nwhere you’re not screwing around with the cosmos like I am.\\nThat is your fixed time.\\nWhere you actually belong.\\nSo by being here and telling me this,\\nyou may have just changed my whole future?\\nHonestly? Your future is pretty tragic either way.\\n[laughs] I’m kidding! I’m kidding.\\nI’m not kidding.\\nI’m kidding. Let’s go. Come on. Here we go.\\n[young Adam] So what happens now?\\nNothin’. I’m just gonna lay down.

I don’t think so.\\n[knocking at door]\\nHi.\\nHi.\\nMe again.\\nYes, it is.\\nYou left your scarf in my car.\\nI did. Gosh, thanks.\\n[Derek] Oh, hey there, kiddo.\\nOh. This is my son, Adam.

It’s unethical.\\nAnd illegal.\\nThis isn’t a joke. It’s dangerous.\\nThe environmental impact alone from the companies you had me pick\\ncould be devastating.\\nIn fairness to us,\\nthe environment was pretty much toast before we came along.\\nAnd by the way, Maya, you did it, all of it,\\nbecause somewhere inside that cheap suit and ridiculous ponytail is me.\\nI’m leaving.\\nWhere you going?\\nYou seeing someone?\\nNo, you’re not. You’re too busy.\\n[clicks tongue] Thing is, you always will be.\\nThis company is all you will ever have.\\n[sighs]\\nIt is your personal life.\\nIt’s your family.\\nBut this is our legacy.\\nAnd if we had let the government take it from us,\\nthen everything we sacrificed,\\nall that loneliness,\\nall that loneliness,\\nwould’ve been for nothing.\\nAnd I did it.\\nI fixed that future where we had been forgotten.\\nThen why are you back here now?\\nI’m back\\nbecause we can’t control time travel if it never existed.\\nAnd your buddy Adam Reed is about to betray you.\\nAdam?

[sighs]\\nAnd I know why you hate him so much.\\nReally?\\n[laughs] Well, do tell. I’m on the edge of my seat here.\\nHoly shit. I wonder what it i… Was it because he’s narcissistic,\\nor, uh, never came home from work\\nor cared more about his job than his son…\\nIt’s because he died.\\nYou hate him\\nbecause he died.\\nYou made yourself hate him\\nbecause it was easier than missing him.\\nAnd I remember some stuff that you maybe don’t wanna.\\nOh yeah?\\nLike what?\\nHe played catch with us\\nalmost every night.\\nCatch.\\nHe’d get home from work,\\nbe so tired, and I’d be in the yard throwing the ball against the pitch back.\\nYou remember the pitch back, right?\\nOh, I… I remember the pitch back.\\nYeah, he bought it so he didn’t have to play with me.\\nNope.\\nHe bought it because they had one in the window of Altman’s.\\nAnd every time we passed that store,\\nI begged him to buy it for me,\\nso that’s what Dad did.\\nHe’d see me throwin’ in the yard, and no matter how tired he was,\\nhe’d always grab his mitt to come out for a catch.\\nThings happened to you, to us.\\nAnd we suck at dealing with it.\\nI’m starting to think it’s something we do.\\nI give Mom a hard time now, and…\\nI think…\\nI think it’s easier to be angry than it is to be sad.\\nAnd I guess, when I get older,\\nI forget that there’s a difference.\\nHow’d you get to be so smart?\\nHow’d you get to be so dumb?\\n[sighs]\\nNice try, asshole.\\n[Ellie] Adam, make sure you feed Hawking before you leave for school, honey.\\nOh.\\n[sizzling]\\nYou’re still here.\\n[Louis] Oh.\\nAnd you’re cooking. What are you making? Hi.\\nUh, I know you like the\\xa0Denver omelet.\\nThat’s not a Denver omelet.

I like this guy.\\nThis guy likes you.\\nWhat’s going on with you, honey?\\nDoes he seem, uh… does he seem sad to you?\\nNo.\\nHe’s an odd duck, like his dad.\\nI happen to collect odd ducks.\\nI don’t know if I should’ve built that game for him.\\nShouldn’t he be outside, playing with the rest of the kids?\\nHow is he gonna find his place in the world?\\n“His place in the world”? He’s a kid. We’re his place in the world.\\nYou’re his place in the world.\\n[sighs] Okay, whatever is going on, listen, I can tell you the truth\\nor something that’s gonna make you feel better.\\nI’d rather cut to it and tell you the truth, if you’re up for it.\\nI… I’d rather something that’ll make me feel better.\\n[laughs] Yeah, I know.\\nKidding. Sort of.\\nOkay, tell me.\\nWhen you are with us… [clicks tongue]\\n…you’re with us\\xa0100%.\\nIt’s amazing.\\nAnd when you’re not…\\n[laughs] …it’s like…\\xa0pfft.\\nSo is he a little lonely?\\nYeah, probably.\\nBut does that make you a shitty guy? No.\\nI’ve gotta do better.\\nHey, buddy, I have good news for you.\\nHe doesn’t need perfect.

We’re gonna blow this bitch up.\\nBlow it up?\\nYep.\\nHow did I live this long? That’s a terrible idea.\\nYeah, well, when a bad idea is the only idea, it becomes a great idea.\\nWho said that?\\nYou.

Where the hell are you going?\\nTo destroy your accelerator, and I’m gonna enjoy it.\\nDo you realize that you have broken every rule?\\nYou’ve blown past every conceivable ethical boundary like it wasn’t there.\\nYeah? Then why are you here, Dad?\\nBecause you can’t do it without me.\\n[sighs]\\nSome people dream of the future.\\nHere at Sorian Technologies, we’re building it.\\n[Louis] If you destroy the accelerator, Sorian will simply rebuild it.\\n[Adam] So what will work?\\n[Louis] What you’re after is\\xa0ISPCA.\\nInfinitely Shifting Plasma Containing Algorithm,\\nwhich I designed to stabilize the wormholes.\\nThat is the mathematical equation that will make time travel possible.\\nHow do you destroy math?\\nI’ve never written the algorithm down or demonstrated it to another human being,\\nso it lives here in the old bean,\\nand in the subbasement in a diamond-hard neuromorphic processor.\\nAre you talking about your penis?\\nCan… can we be serious now?\\nYes. No. Yes.\\nIt’s a hard drive, okay?\\n[chuckles]\\nGod, you’re such a child.\\nSorry.\\nThere is a crystal hard drive running the algorithm in a closed loop.\\nThat is the nerve center of the accelerator.\\nSo we go there, destroy the hard drive, prevent time travel from being invented.\\nTheoretically, time travel…\\nOh my God!

Managed to put the entire class to sleep.\\n[lecturer] …force is directly…\\nYou look awake.\\nNo. No, no, no, no, no.\\nI’ve trained myself to…\\nTo fall fast asleep but keep my eyes open.\\nCheck it out.\\n[snoring]\\n[laughs]\\n…gotta believe in the miracle…\\nAre you serious?\\n[snoring]\\nCool, right?\\nYeah.\\nYeah.\\nSuper cool.

Yeah.\\nShit.\\nWhat’s your field?\\nUm… computational linguistics.\\nNo way!\\nYeah.\\nI don’t know what that is. Um…\\nOh.\\nWhat does that have to do with flying?\\nUh… not a damn thing.\\nOh.\\nYeah.\\nOh. You’re in the wrong place, I think.\\nThat’s subjective. This is Schaefer 309?\\nLiterally in the wrong place.\\xa0Farrel 309.\\nNo.\\nYep.\\nNo.\\nYeah.\\n[Laura] I don’t think that…\\n[Adam] Yeah. Oof.\\nOkay. Oh.\\nI knew it.\\nOkay. All right.\\nBingo. Yeah.\\nOkay. Okay.\\nThen I’m in the wrong building.\\nActually, you’re in the wrong campus.\\n[sighs]\\nThen I’m lost.\\nNot anymore.
